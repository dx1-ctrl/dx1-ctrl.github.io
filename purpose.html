        <h2>Purpose of DJV2</h2>
        <p>DJV2 was designed as a user-friendly platform that makes retro gaming accessible to everyone. Originally developed to help my mom enjoy her nostalgic DOS games, DJV2 has evolved into a powerful tool for retro gaming enthusiasts of all ages.</p>
        
        <h3>My Mission</h3>
        <p>I aim to bridge the gap between classic DOS games and modern technology, offering a simple interface that allows users to launch, customize, and manage their favorite DOS games seamlessly.</p>
        
        <h3>Why DJV2 Stands Out</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>User-Focused Design:</strong> Created to make retro gaming simple and enjoyable, regardless of technical expertise.</li>
            <li><strong>Community Support:</strong> I continuously update DJV2 with new features based on feedback from my users.</li>
            <li><strong>Enhanced Accessibility:</strong> Eliminates the technical challenges typically associated with DOSBox setups.</li>
        </ul>
